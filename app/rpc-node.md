# ‚òÅ RPC NODE

To ensure that no one collects the user's confidential data, such as

* ip address
* time zone data
* device information

We use our own NEAR RPC node. Also, we use powerful server hardware and our view methods are 60-70% faster than on the official RPC node.

You can also use our RPC node at `rpc.herewallet.app`
